👑 Hi, I'm Ramii (@Ramiifr)

She/They | Developer since 2017

I’m a builder at heart, currently obsessed with making Discord Bots and Local AI Assistants more intuitive and powerful. If it involves automation or an API, I’m probably into it.

🛠 My Multilingual Toolbox
Area:	Technologies
Languages: Java, Python, JS, HTML, C#	
Focus:	Discord API, Cyber Security, Local LLMs, Linux CLI
OS:	Mainly on Windows but switching to Linux soon! (Currently learning the CLI ropes!)

Current Goals:

  🤖 Discord Bots: Building custom integrations (Ask me about them, I love them sm <3).
  
  🧠 Local AI: Developing a privacy-focused assistant that runs on my own hardware.

  🛡️ Security: Learning how to keep my code (and yours) safe from the bad actors.

  Status Report

  👯 Collaboration: Quiet for now. Check back when the coffee levels are higher!

  🤔 Help Needed: If you are a Linux CLI wizard, teach me your ways.

  ⚡ Fun Fact: I’ve been staring at code since 2017—I’ve seen some things.
